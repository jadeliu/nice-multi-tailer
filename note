# Assumptions:
1.log validation: if no 'at' timestamp, use the arrival time instead

2.timezone in timestamp: python strptime did not parse 'PDT', for simplicity, I'm assuming all records are from the same timezone

#Queue and Scheduling:
1. a thread safe fixed size priority queue is used; the queue is sorted by 'at' stamp
2. for fairness, only one line is read from each file
